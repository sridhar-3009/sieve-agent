"""Google Calendar — read your real schedule, with a sign-in you can actually do.

Two doors, deliberately different:

  READ   (calendar.events.readonly)  sieve_agent's own OAuth client, shipped below.
         Click, approve in the browser, done. No files to download.

  WRITE  (calendar.events)           your own `.sieve/credentials.json`.
         Creating events on someone's calendar is a sensitive scope, so sieve_agent
         does not ask for it on your behalf — you bring your own client.

Why the read client can live in a public repo: for Google's "Desktop app" OAuth
client type the secret is not confidential, and Google says so. It identifies
the app, it does not authorise anything. Nobody can read your calendar with it;
every user still approves in their own browser and their token is stored only on
their machine. This is what gcloud and rclone do. The blast radius of a leak is
brand impersonation and quota, not data — which is exactly why READ is shipped
and WRITE is not.

Everything here is best-effort and honest: a missing dependency, a refused
consent or an expired token returns a sentence explaining what to do, never an
exception, because a calendar hiccup must not take down a chat turn.
