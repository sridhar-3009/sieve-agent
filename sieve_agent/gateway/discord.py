"""Discord gateway — message Sieve from a direct message or a server channel.

READ THIS BEFORE PUTTING THE BOT IN A SHARED SERVER.

This gateway runs YOUR agent: your memory (`.sieve/state.db`), your SOUL.md, your
tools. Anyone it answers can ask what it remembers about you, and — because the
chat log feeds consolidation — anything they say can become a permanent fact in
your memory. A bot sitting in a busy channel is therefore three problems at
once, not one:

  cost       every message it answers is a full agent turn, billed to your key
  privacy    strangers can read your personal facts back out
  integrity  their conversation gets distilled into your long-term memory

So the default posture is DENY, and it takes deliberate configuration to open
up. With nothing configured the bot answers direct messages only and ignores
every server channel completely.

Setup:
  1. Create a bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications
  2. Enable the Message Content Intent on the bot page
  3. Put DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=... in .env and invite the bot to your server
  4. Open it up only as far as you actually need (all optional):

     DISCORD_ALLOWED_USER      comma-separated numeric user ids. Empty = anyone
                               may DM the bot. Set this if the bot is reachable
                               by people you don't know.
     DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL   comma-separated numeric channel ids. Empty means
                               NO server channel is answered. This is the switch
                               that keeps a 500-person Discord from billing you.
     DISCORD_REQUIRE_MENTION   default "1". In a server channel, only reply when
                               the bot is @-mentioned. Set "0" at your own risk.
     DISCORD_MAX_TURNS_PER_HOUR  default 30. A hard ceiling across all users; the
                               bot goes quiet once it's hit rather than spending.
     DISCORD_HOME              a SEPARATE .sieve for the bot. Use this whenever
                               the bot serves anyone but you — it gets its own
                               memory, so a community bot can never read or
                               poison your personal one.
