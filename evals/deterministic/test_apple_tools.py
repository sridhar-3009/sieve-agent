"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the Apple tools, and the rule that keeps them usable.

Every Apple tool timed out on a real Mac on 2026-07-30 while this suite stayed
green. The reason is worth stating plainly, because it is a lesson about evals
and not about AppleScript: the only existing test asserted on generated STRINGS,
and one of its cases did nothing at all on macOS —

    # on macOS we can't run osascript in CI, but the escaping is in the string
    # build; covered by the pure date test above + manual verification

"manual verification on the dev machine" is not a test. So sieve_agent advertised four
Apple tools, and three of them did not work.

CI has no Calendar.app, so we still cannot assert "reading really works". What we
CAN pin is the rule that made it stop working, and the honesty of the failures:

  * no `whose` filter in any generated script  (25s vs 6s, measured)
  * every osascript call has a timeout, and a failure returns a SENTENCE
  * a slow app must fail fast — a tool that blocks a turn for 75s then
    apologises is worse than a tool that says "no" in 20

Timings referenced below were measured on a 472-event Google-synced calendar and
a Mail.app that could not `count of messages of inbox` inside two minutes.
